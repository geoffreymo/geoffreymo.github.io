## About me

I'm a PhD candidate in the [LIGO Lab at MIT](https://ligolab.mit.edu/) and at the [MKI Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research](https://space.mit.edu/), where I work with Erik Katsavounidis on multi-messenger astrophysics. 
Previously, I was an undergraduate at [Carleton College](https://carleton.edu/).

I'm interested in gravitational waves, compact binaries, multi-messenger astronomy, and how we can use both gravity and light to learn about the universe.
I'm involved with using [TESS](https://tess.mit.edu/) and [WINTER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01109) to look for electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves.
More recently, I've been thinking about searching for ultracompact binaries with periodicity searches in time-domain surveys.

If you'd like to chat, feel free to email me at [gmo@mit.edu](mailto:gmo.mit.edu)!

## Research interests

- **Multi-messenger astrophysics**: electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves, sky localization of gravitational waves, gravitational waves from unusual sources
- **Compact binaries**: periodicity searches, ultracompact binaries, binary progenitors, compact binaries in globular clusters
- **LIGO**: low-latency infrastructure, [gwcelery](https://git.ligo.org/emfollow/gwcelery), detector characterization
- **All-sky surveys**: [WINTER](http://winter.caltech.edu/), [TESS](https://tess.mit.edu/), [ZTF](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/)


## Service

I am passionate about making physics and astrophysics more inclusive,
and have been involved in efforts to make meaningful changes in my department and beyond.

- Admissions for the MIT Summer Research Program, targeted at recruiting underrepresented undergradutes to spend a summer conducting research at MIT (2021, 2022, 2023, 2024)
- Mentor for MIT PhysGAAP, a program to help prospective graduate students with their applications to help foster a diverse graduate student body (2023)
- MIT Kavli Institute coffee czar (2022 - present)
- Faculty search committee, MIT Astrophysics (2021)
- MIT Kavli Institute Anti-Racism Task Force (2020)
- Various roles at Carleton, including being a Student Departmental Advisor and serving on the Departmental Curriculum Committee (2017-2019)


## Teaching
I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to teach and mentor students at MIT and at Carleton.

### MIT
- TA for 8.021 E&M (Fall 2020, Fall 2022, Fall 2023)
- Graduate student mentor for three undergraduate researchers (2020-2022)

### Carleton
- Undergraduate TA and lab assistant for E&M, Contemporary Physics Lab, and Intro to Astronomy (2017-2019)
- Department-appointed tutor for E&M

## Publications
I've included below papers for which I've made direct contributions.
As a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration since 2018, I am also an author on LSC collaboration papers.
