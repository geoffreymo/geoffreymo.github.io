## About me

Hi! I'm a Brinson Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Carnegie Observatories](https://carnegiescience.edu/obs) and at [Caltech](https://www.astro.caltech.edu/).
I earned my PhD at MIT, at the [MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research](https://space.mit.edu/) and at the [LIGO Lab](https://ligolab.mit.edu/).
Before that, I was an undergraduate at [Carleton College](https://carleton.edu/).

I'm interested in how compact binaries form, evolve, and die, and how we might learn about them in both light and gravitational waves.
In particular, I'm leading a _Hubble_ ultraviolet [time-domain survey](https://www.stsci.edu/hst-program-info/program/?program=17724) of the globular cluster 47 Tuc to search for the binaries which live in these dense stellar environments.
I'm also working on building _Cerberus_, a three-channel high-speed imager for the 200-inch Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory, which will provide precise photometry for characterizing binaries.

If you'd like to chat, feel free to email me at [gmo@caltech.edu](mailto:gmo.caltech.edu)!

## Research interests

- **Compact binaries**: compact binaries in globular clusters, ultracompact binaries, Type Ia supernovae
- **Multi-messenger astrophysics**: electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves, sky localization of gravitational waves
- **Instrumentation**: low-noise, high-speed imaging
- **Transients in all-sky surveys**: [WINTER](http://winter.caltech.edu/), [NEOWISE](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/neowise/)
- **LIGO**: low-latency infrastructure, [gwcelery](https://git.ligo.org/emfollow/gwcelery), detector characterization


## Service

I am passionate about making physics and astrophysics more inclusive,
and have been involved in efforts to make meaningful changes in my department and beyond.

- Admissions for the MIT Summer Research Program, targeted at recruiting underrepresented undergradutes to spend a summer conducting research at MIT (2021, 2022, 2023, 2024)
- Mentor for MIT PhysGAAP, a program to help prospective graduate students with their applications to help foster a diverse graduate student body (2023)
- MIT Kavli Institute coffee czar (2022 - present)
- Faculty search committee, MIT Astrophysics (2021)
- MIT Kavli Institute Anti-Racism Task Force (2020)
- Various roles at Carleton, including being a Student Departmental Advisor and serving on the Departmental Curriculum Committee (2017-2019)


## Teaching
I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to teach and mentor students at MIT and at Carleton.

### MIT
- TA for 8.021 E&M (Fall 2020, Fall 2022, Fall 2023, Fall 2024)
- Graduate student mentor for three undergraduate researchers (2020-2022)

### Carleton
- Undergraduate TA and lab assistant for E&M, Contemporary Physics Lab, and Intro to Astronomy (2017-2019)
- Department-appointed tutor for E&M
